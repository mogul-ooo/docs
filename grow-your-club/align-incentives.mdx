## **Transparency** 

Ensure all members understand the 2% reward structure and the specific distribution split you set during club creation. Reference the Rewards tab.

## Connect Rewards to Growth

Frame the rewards as a direct benefit of collective growth and investment activity. When the club succeeds, everyone benefits.

## Celebrate Milestones

Acknowledge significant achievements related to rewards, member growth, or collective investment milestones to reinforce the positive cycle and thus have more people referring their friends to join.
