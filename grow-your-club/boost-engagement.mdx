## **Be Present and Lead by Example**

As the Chief Mogul, your activity sets the tone. Post regularly, respond to comments, and actively participate in discussions.

## **Initiate Discussions**

Donâ€™t wait for others. Start conversations about market trends, specific property analyses (linking to available mogul properties), or ask thought-provoking questions.

## **Encourage Member Contributions**

Actively solicit opinions, insights, and questions from your members. Tag members if appropriate when asking questions relevant to their known interests.

## **Utilize Platform Features**

Leverage tools within the mogul platform. Use polls to gauge interest, facilitate Q&A sessions, and remind members of the option to post anonymously if they prefer.

## Maintain Momentum

Consistency is key. Aim for regular updates, posts, or discussion prompts to keep the club active and prevent it from becoming stagnant.
