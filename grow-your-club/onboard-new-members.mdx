**Personal Welcome Message:** Whenever possible, send a direct welcome message to new members. Briefly reiterate the club’s purpose and encourage them to introduce themselves to other members.

**Set Expectations:** Have a pinned post or clear section in your club description outlining community guidelines, expected behavior, and how members can get the most value from being a part of your community.

**Encourage Initial Participation:** Create an easy first step for engagement. This could be an introduction thread, a simple poll, or asking a broad opening question related to the club’s focus. Giving them an easy initial step makes them comfortable and more eager to engage.
