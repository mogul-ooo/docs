## **Share Educational Resources** 

Post relevant articles, market studies, videos, or links to external resources that align with your club’s focus. Frame them with your own insights or questions to spark discussion.

## **Facilitate Property Discussions**

Use mogul’s available properties as focal points for discussion. Encourage members to share their analysis, ask questions about specific deals, and discuss potential investments.

## Bring in External Insights (Optional)

Consider occasionally inviting guest experts (if feasible and appropriate) for Q&A sessions or sharing insights from relevant podcasts or webinars.

## Focus on Financial Literacy

Align with mogul’s goal of making financial literacy approachable. Break down complex topics and encourage peer-to-peer learning. Remember, our team is always happy to help with any complex questions\!
