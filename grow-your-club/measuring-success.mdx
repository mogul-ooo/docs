## Monitor Key Metrics

Regularly check the data available to you (via the Rewards tab and other analytics provided by your account manager). Pay attention to:

- Active Member Count & Growth Rate
- Total Amount Invested by Club Members
- Rewards Distributed
- Engagement Levels (Posts, comments, reactions)

## Gather Member Feedback

Periodically ask your members for feedback. What do they find most valuable? What could be improved? Use polls or open-ended questions to encourage active and actionable feedback.

## Adapt Your Strategy

Use the metrics and feedback gathered to refine your club recruitment, content, and engagement strategies over time as your community grows.
