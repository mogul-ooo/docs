<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Initiate Club Creation">
    Navigate to the main **Clubs** section within your mogul account. Click the prominent **\+ Create club** button, found at the bottom of the Clubs menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Name Your Club">
    A prompt will appear asking for your club name. Enter a clear, concise, and relevant name for your community. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Complete Your Chief Mogul Profile">
    This is your public-facing profile as the leader of the club. Make it informative and welcoming\!

    - **Profile Picture:** Upload a professional headshot (recommended size: 600x600 pixels).
    - **Name:** Confirm your display name.
    - **Bio:** Write a brief biography introducing yourself and your investment interests or expertise.
    - **Socials:** Add links to your relevant social media profiles (Website, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube) to build trust and connection with your club members.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Define Your Club Information">
    This is what potential members will see when discovering your club.

    - **Club One Liner: **Create a short, catchy tagline that summarizes your club’s focus.
    - **Description:** Write a detailed description covering:
      - The club’s mission and goals.
      - Who the ideal member is.
      - What topics will be discussed.
      - Any specific rules or expectations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Decide Your Privacy Level">
    Choose how visible and accessible your club will be:

    - **Public: **Discoverable by anyone. Members can join automatically when they request to join.
    - **Private:** Discoverable by anyone. Members must request to join, and you (the Chief Mogul) approve or deny requests.
    - **Hidden:** Not discoverable. Only invited members can see or join. Fully private option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6: Configure Club Rewards">
    mogul redistributes part of its revenue generated from investments made by club members back with the club (at no cost to the end investor). The amount is 2% of dollars invested. As Chief Mogul, you decide how this reward is distributed.

    - Enter the percentage share allocated to the **Chief mogul share (%).**
    - Enter the percentage share allocated to the **Member share (%)**. (Note: These two must add up to 100%).
    - The example calculation shows how the reward is applied based on a sample investment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 7: Add Club Media">
    Visuals help attract members to your club, so make sure to include some that match the brand identity of your club and community\!

    - **Club Logo: **Upload a square logo representing your club (required size: 600x600 pixels).
    - **Club Banner:** Upload a wider banner image for your club page (required size: 1000x410 pixels).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 8: Review and Publish">
    You will be presented with a preview of your club setup in draft mode. Review all the information, ensuring everything is correct (Club Name, Info, Privacy, Rewards, Media). Make any necessary final edits. When ready, click the **Publish** button to make your club live and start sharing it with your community\!
